1. The bug is the fact that `calculateSum()` does addition between two `string` type elements. As a result, the value of the addition is a string concatenation between num1 and num2 and not an addition between numbers.
2. You would fix it by making sure that you are doing arithmetic between number type and not string type. This can be fixed by using `parseInt(string)` function which will convert a string to a number
